# Aave Flashloan Starter Project

## Overview

This project is a starter kit for developing decentralized applications (Dapps) using Aave's flashloan feature. Flash loans allow users to borrow and repay a loan within a single transaction, enabling unique use-cases such as arbitrage, collateral swapping, self-liquidation, and more. 

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following:

1. Node.js and npm installed on your local machine.
2. Hardhat or Truffle installed as your Ethereum development framework.
3. Aave protocol forked and cloned on your local machine. You can fork it [here](https://github.com/aave/aave-protocol).

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository and navigate into it.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using npm install.
3. Create a new .env file in the root directory of the project and add your environment variables.
4. The starter project includes a simple flashloan contract in Solidity. You can find it at /contracts/MyFlashLoanContract.sol. This contract inherits from Aave's FlashLoanReceiverBase.sol and implements the executeOperation function.
5. Replace "path_to_aave/FlashLoanReceiverBase.sol" and "path_to_aave/ILendingPoolAddressesProvider.sol" in FlashLoan.sol with the actual paths to the appropriate Aave contracts in the repository.
6. Implement your own logic in the executeOperation function. This is the code that will be executed as part of the flash loan.
7. Once your contract is ready, you can deploy it to a testnet or mainnet using a tool like Truffle or Hardhat.

## Creating a Flashloan Contract

The starter project includes a simple flashloan contract in Solidity. You can find it at `/contracts/MyFlashLoanContract.sol`. This contract inherits from Aave's `FlashLoanReceiverBase.sol` and implements the `executeOperation` function. 

## Deploying the Contract

To deploy your contract onto a testnet, follow these steps:

1. Update `scripts/DeployContract.js` with the address of your Aave LendingPoolAddressesProvider on the network you are deploying to.
2. Run the deploy script with `npx hardhat run scripts/DeployContract.js --network <network-name>`

## Testing with Tenderly's Simulation Features

Once your contract is deployed, you can use Tenderly's simulation features to test it. Connect your project to Tenderly's SDK and run your transaction simulations. 

## Conclusion

This starter project provides you with the basic setup for implementing flash loans using the Aave protocol. For a more detailed guide, please refer to our [blog post](link_to_your_blog_post).

## Disclaimer

Flash loans are powerful but come with risks, especially around smart contract vulnerabilities and market risks. Always ensure thorough testing and auditing before deploying on the mainnet.
